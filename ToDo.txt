/- LoggerFiber that is subscribed to an incoming channel, then publishes to other channel when logging done
/- Logs connections from websockets
/- Functions to give both incoming and outcoming channels
/- Function to log incoming message - in fact have a logging class?
/- Class that takes a socket, processes the handshake request and sends the response

- Implement ClientMessage class - what does it actually need?

- Add socket to AcceptedConnections once handshake done
- Iterate over all AcceptedConnections and check for messages
- Once message received, create ClientMessage and publish to channel


- Have a server class that keeps track of all connections and when a new connection appears, passes it to a fiber for processing

- Have a class that contains the two channels, the server (which contains the websocket handler maybe) and the logger
